"""Planner that replays a recorded plan instead of asking an LLM.

The other backends put a model in the loop and let it decide what to do next.
This one replays a **task card** recorded from an earlier run: the actions,
their order, the prompts given to the policy and the gripper commands are all
fixed before the episode starts. Only perception is live, and it is what makes
the card transferable -- every waypoint is re-expressed against a fresh reading
of the object it was written relative to.

What a card holds, and how it is replayed, is the robot's business: this asks
the robot's :attr:`~rpent.robots.robot_spec.RobotSpec.replay_card` hook to run
the cell and reports what came back.
