"""One LIBERO task card: what it holds, and how it is replayed.

The card supplies the actions; perception supplies the coordinates. Each anchor
is re-read through the interface it was first read through -- a `segment` anchor
is re-segmented, because its offsets are relative to a mask centroid, and a wide
container seen at an angle has that centroid some way from where a pointing
model points. Point-grounded anchors are localized through the grounder.

Localization is two-stage: a coarse survey of the opening frame, then the arm
parks over each point-grounded anchor and asks again from the wrist, where the
object fills the view. The close reading is kept only when it agrees with the
coarse one, so a wrist view that found something else cannot overwrite a
correct answer.
